                <ul>
                    <li> <em> Socail Implications </em>
                        <p>There have been many social implications mentioned throught this pandemic. We lose the ability to read facial expressions and children are having a harder time developing their communication skills due to this. Depression has incresed due to the social isolation that some people have had to endure much more than others. </p>
                    <li> <em> Economic Implications </em>
                        <p>Jobs have been suspended, lost, and now are empty. Our economy is in for a harsh relaity due to the stimulous checks that we will have to ultimatley pay back. Holiday spending has been almost non existent these past two year and hospital bills have more people drowing than ever before</p>
                    <li> <em> Politicl Implications </em>
                        <p>Our politics are and i belive always has been a mess. The fighting that these mandates have brought it astronomical. People are angry and politicians cant do much more than fight with each other </p>
