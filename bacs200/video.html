                        <p>Hello, my name is Ashley Spickard. I am a senior at UNC studying accounting. I have a dog and she is my whole life. I love musicals and the people who know me often say I am an old lady in a young lady’s body. I’m just your average goofball, I guess. I collect teacups, I enjoy a good puzzle or board game, and solitaire is my favorite mobile game. My plans for the future involve a steady and reliable job where I can do a small business of my own on the side. I started my college career at CU Boulder in general business. I always knew I wanted to have my own business someday and when I started working at a doggy day care, I decided to focus on building that dream instead of continuing on in college. I started at the very bottom and worked my way up to management in a few years. I was their marketing manager for a while until I realized that me passions do not involve marketing and I decided to go back to the daycare side of things. I was offered an assistant manager position shortly after that. The same day I was offered that, I actually ended up quitting. I was so honored to be offered the job however that was the moment I realized that I wanted more than a general management position at a doggy day care working with people who could not care less about anything. I quit my job and that same week I enrolled in classes at a community college. After completing community college, I moved on to UNC and now here I am, one semester from graduation I chose accounting because I really enjoy numbers, I like budgets and balancing things. I also really love Excel so I looked into majors that would involve that. I fell in love with my accounting courses at community college and just decided to go for it. I am very excited to see what the future will hold for me. It has been a long road, but I am happy to be getting a degree in something I enjoy. </p>

                        <p>Thank you for watching my introduction video and i hope you have awonderful day</p>
